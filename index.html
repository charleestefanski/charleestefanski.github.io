    <h2>Stripping yoga to its roots</h2>

    <p>We are a group of dedicated yoga teachers who are passionate about bringing donation-based yoga to Ann Arbor. We have a pay-as-you-can approach to our classes because we truly believe that yoga is all about you and your breath; the rest is just excess. We offer a variety of classes that are all taught by certified teachers who bring their own energy to the room. We are cultivating a space of growth, healing, and love. Come get nak*d with us!</p>
